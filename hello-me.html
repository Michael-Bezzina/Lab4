			Welcome to my website! My name is Michael Bezzina. I'm currently a CS Major/TAM Minor looking to flip degrees. I find that my greatest interest lies largely in front-end work rather than back-end which is the reason for my future switch. As for some random background information, I was born overseas in small country named Malta and came over to Colorado when I was two. I really enjoy movies and games, as well as playing soccer and participating in other athletic activities. Although I usually view IGN news from Youtube, I could get lost in their <a href="http://www.ign.com/">website</a> with all of their content for games, movies and more.
